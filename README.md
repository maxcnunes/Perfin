Perfin
======

What is the Perfin
================
This is an **open oource** small web application for Personal Financial Control.


Why Open Source
==================
This project have being developed for two reasons:
1. We have not found any app that we really liked and enjoyed to use for a long time.
2. We have been seen many new frameworks and patterns lately emerging and this app was the best way we found to practice all these news.


Configurations
=============

1. Install [MySQL Community Server 5.5.29](http:// "http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/")
2. Install [MySQL Connector/Net 6.6.4](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/)
3. Create the databse "Perfin"
4. Execute the script `\Perfin\Perfin\Scripts.Database\GenerateMySQLDatabse.sql` into the database.
5. Installing NuGet packages from packages.config executing `c:\path\to\nuget.exe install -o packages project-folder\packages.config` or just Turn on "Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build" on Visual Studio as you can see on [Scott Halseman Post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NuGet20NETPackageManagerReleasedGOUPGRADENOWAndHeresWhy.aspx)
